# SelfWatch

A whimsical app with tools or games to keep an open mindset

## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration

I apply a lot of thought work to learning how to code and debugging. As such, I don't have as much of the emotional roller coasters that junior developers typically do. I want to share my knowledge and perspective to help other developers have an easier learning curve.

## ðŸ¤” Purpose

Help devs stay in a better headspace while getting through the learning curves of becoming a software engineer.

## What it does

A feature of questions to help devs ask more questions and to stay curious about debugging. It also has suggestions to take breaks and to take care of biological needs

Another feature is a whimsical magic 8 ball game. The answers are designed to encourage developers to ask more questions and to stay curious

## ðŸŽ¨ Design

SelfWatch was first designed using Figma before it was coded. Below are the wireframes and designs that the team used.

## ðŸ›  How we Built it

- React
- Next
- Vite
- Tailwind

## âœ¨ Proud Achievements

Successful implementation of React structure and Next app router.

## ðŸ˜¤ Challenges Encountered

I accidentally made the app with the pages router instead of app router. I restarted it and kept it in the same Github repo.

## ðŸ™Œ Insights from SelfWatch

This is a pretty simple app and I'm pleased that I was able to make it so easily.

## ðŸš€ What's next for SelfWatch

8-ball game

- Add a pop-up upon loading explaining that this is a game, not divination
- More answers

Debugging Support

- animate the duck
- animate the celebration of finding the bug
